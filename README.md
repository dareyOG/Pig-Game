The pig game is a game of dice in which two players (players 1 and 2) race to reach at least 100 points.
Each player take turns to repeatedly roll the die until either a 1 is rolled or the player holds and scores
the sum of the rolls (run score).

A player is faced with two decisons:

*Roll:*
when a 1 is rolled,  the player's run score is returned to zero and it becomes the opposing player's turn, 
otherwise the number rolled is added to the run score.

*Hold:*
the run score is added to the player's total score and it becomes the turn of the opposing player.
